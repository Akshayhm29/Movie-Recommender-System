A recommender system, or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications.






The recommender system deals with a large volume of information present by filtering the most important information based on the data provided by a user and other factors that take care of the user’s preference and interest. It finds out the match between user and item and imputes the similarities between users and items for recommendation.




Movie recommendation systems use a set of different filtration strategies and algorithms to help users find the most relevant films. The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.
